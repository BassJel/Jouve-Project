		This is the Solr schema file. This file should be named "schema.xml" and should be in the conf directory under the solr home (i.e. ./solr/conf/schema.xml by default) or located where the classloader for the Solr webapp can find it. This example schema is the recommended starting point for users.
		It should be kept correct and concise, usable out-of-the-box. For more information, on how to customize this file, please see http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SchemaXml
